We are climbing cats!

A little background. My fiends and I will climb the CN Tower (apparently by stairs) on April 7th to raise funds for WWF. To make it a bit more fun, I decided to design some logos and put them on shirts.

## The Referential Artwork

Due to the pathetic truth that I can not draw, I desperately long for some pre existing artwork as design reference. After a long search I found this guy [here](http://www.pinsdaddy.com/art-for-sale_%7C3UPHGFEP2fYQ*tFSM5qsNd2rJ9rYqWc1NrEW36WrGU/bG6o95OgOc3jAuZIsi4NyAWxU0cezwwD0MbNRrs30NxYJK*wCLmgrBxGTDaxdSK79PHDalHAvh5ralpbXgpCmKjRkL%7C4tcH9hiNYTHfAC7bPu%7CkEi7QOseNMToSXdP1E/).

The picture is good for redesign for several reasons:

1. It's a climbing cat and the team love cats and we are going to climb.
2. It's an artwork which, unlike photographs, has distinct sharp edges between the cat and the background. This is good for future work in photoshop.
3. The colors of cat are uneven, which also distinguish it from the background. This gives distinct sections after averaing color into low poly art which will be illustrated below.

## Low Poly Cats

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_poly), low poly is a polygon mesh in 3D computer graphics that has a relatively small number of polygons.

An [example](http://renanbrsl.blogspot.com/2015/03/2d-low-poly-art.html) can be a low poly apple as below, which is good start converting [The Son of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_of_Man) into low poly art (just kidding).

A bunch of tuturials can be found online converting photos into the art form, such as [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyOqH9Q2GE). The key to not create something unpleasant is:

1. The original photo is better to have distinct colors and edges.
2. The arrangement of poly sections affect overall perception.
3. Color pallete matters.

After some hours of strugging with this little cat, I finally came with some results below. The left cat was the fresh out of canvas one of which the colors were derived by averaging sections in the referential art. The middle one was created by adjust hue of the left one which intend to offer a feel of contradiction on dark color shirts. The right serves those with a love for mono and simpleness.

## Initials

To offer the shirts some personalities to the team members, I designed initials in a diamond form. The idea was originally from [here](https://stock.adobe.com/images/initial-letters-logo-bb-black-monogram-diamond-pentagon-shape/168002555). Then I added some twists to fit every ones' names.

## Printing

Some trails and errors were made on a shirt template in photoshop. Also it was a hard choice to balance cost and design since most companies charge extra money for patterns on the back.

So we decided to put everything in the front and give it a try.

We chose a customed printed shirt service and it turned out pretty fast and good. The only complain about the work is they used the heat pressing technique which is fine for light color shirts but adds a rubber feeling to patterns on dark ones. This prevents the natural breathing of material and cause discomfort with sweats.

Updates: our shirts draw a lot of attention during the climbing. Truly not bad for my very first attempt.
